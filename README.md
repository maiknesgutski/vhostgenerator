#VHOSTGENERATOR

This VHOST generating bash script is what I wrote and use to automate symlinking my project folders
into my /var/www folder and to automatically generate a fitting VHOSTS file in the etc/apache2/sites-available/
directory.

I'm a totla noob at shell scripting and there are probably way better ways to do this but thats what I tinkered
together in a rush because I got sick of doing it by hand.
